# Engine preflight for the TWO-NODE recipe, run by harem-exl3-tp2.service as
# ExecStartPre on both nodes. It is motor-onkosul-exl3.sh with exactly two
# differences, and they are the ones docs/15 section 2.6 names:
#
#   * FABRIC_PEERS is ONE address per node, not two. Two nodes are one peer
#     pair joined by one cable pair; the third node's links are not part of
#     this cluster and waiting for them would hang the boot.
#   * the default ENV_FILE is .env.tp2prod-fs (the full-scope candidate).
#
# Everything else is unchanged, deliberately:
#   1. docker is up and answering
#   2. all four ConnectX-7 ports report PORT_ACTIVE (ibv_devinfo) -- STILL 4/4.
#      That counts ports on this node, not peers, and a node whose other two
#      ports are down has a hardware problem worth failing on even when this
#      cluster does not use them.
#   3. this node can ping its fabric neighbour
#   4. sync + drop_caches
#   5. the env file exists
#   6. the image named in it is present locally
#   7. this rank's fast-load sidecar has its MANIFEST.json
#
# The addresses below follow the example range in docs/00 section 4.5 -- they
# are NOT ours and you must substitute your own. Set FABRIC_PEERS in the
# environment instead if you prefer not to edit the file.
#
#   head      FABRIC_PEERS="172.31.0.2"
#   worker-1  FABRIC_PEERS="172.31.0.1"
#
# And read the reboot rule with it: at two ranks you reboot BOTH nodes together
# or neither. This preflight passes on a single node whose peer is gone, then
# starts a rank into a cluster that will never form (docs/00 section 3.4).
