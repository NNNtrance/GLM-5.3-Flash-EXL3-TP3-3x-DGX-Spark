# In-container prelude for GLM-5.3-Flash EXL3 at TP=2 -- PRODUCTION CANDIDATE ARM.
#
# This is the two-node counterpart of tp3full/tp3-prelude.sh. It runs the same
# patch scripts, byte for byte, MINUS everything that exists only because three
# ranks need padding:
#
#   not here, and why
#     patch-vllm-tp3.py        the zero-extend helper for a shard that runs past
#                              the stored dim. At tp=2 nothing is padded (heads
#                              64/2, vocab 154880/2 = 605 x 128, shared expert
#                              2048/2 = 8 x 128), so the branch can never fire.
#                              Harmless to keep; not shipped, because we have
#                              never measured a two-node arm carrying it.
#     patch-exl3-ep.py         + overlay/: the cuda-exl3 EP kernel fixes. EP is
#                              off at two ranks (ENABLE_EP=0).
#     patch-dflash-tp3.py      makes the DFlash2 head check pad-aware over the
#                              32/8 -> 36/9 drafter pad. There is no such pad at
#                              tp=2: 32/8 divides by two.
#     patch-fullscope-tp3.py   its A9/A10 are the padded-load audit. The tp=2
#                              equivalent is patch-fullscope-tp2.py, below.
#     check-padload-tp3.py     gates a cuda-exl3 capability only the padded-load
#                              path needs.
#     pad-tp3.py/pad-tp3full.py  build padded sidecars. Nothing to pad.
#     patch-zerokv-tp3.py      an optional arm, never in production 10's env.
#
# Every optional patch is conditional on its own env knob, so an env file that
# asks for nothing behaves exactly like the unpatched image.
#
#   TP2_STRICT=0 downgrades a failed patch to a warning. Do not use it to get
#   past a broken anchor: a half-patched stack is the failure mode that serves
#   fluent, wrong answers.
#
# Mount this at /start.sh and launch the image with `--entrypoint bash /start.sh`.
# It is hard-linked to tp3-prelude.sh inside the same directory ON PURPOSE: the
# fastload identity (harem_fastload_id.file_identity) hashes the prelude under
# the name "tp3-prelude.sh", so the hard link is what keeps the prelude's text
# inside the sidecar manifest at two ranks. One inode, so the two names cannot
# drift apart.

# --- The sparse indexer's K-gather workspace (6 September 2026) --------------
# Upstream sizes it as 40 * max_model_len ENTRIES -- a constant chosen against
# DeepSeek-V3.2's 163,840-token context, where it comes to 825 MB. At
# max_model_len 1,000,000 the same constant reserves 40,000,000 x 132 B =
# 4.92 GiB, during the profile run, locked by lock_workspace() for the life of
# the engine, and charged to the residual the profiler subtracts BEFORE it sizes
# the KV pool. The buffer only ever holds ONE indexer chunk's COMPRESSED
# context, so its real ceiling is
#     max_num_seqs * ceil((max_model_len + num_spec + 1) / index_kpool).
#
# EVERY TERM IS PER ENGINE, NOT PER RANK, so the same 4.92 GiB is reserved at
# two ranks as at three -- against a pool that is a third the size. Measured on
# both: +10.25 % of pool at three ranks, +32.14 % at two on the same eager-boot
# comparison, and +26.5 % against the previous two-node recipe once the fast-load
# sidecar is back. Measurements: results/memory/indexer-workspace-ab.md and
# docs/15 section 5.9. The file is the three-node track's, unchanged: the bound
# reads nothing that knows the rank count.
#
# The patch is applied UNCONDITIONALLY here and its BEHAVIOUR is env-gated,
# default OFF:
#   HAREM_INDEXER_WS_MODE unset / off / upstream  -> upstream sizing, byte for
#       byte, guards L2+L3 disarmed (one environment read at import).
#   HAREM_INDEXER_WS_MODE=bound                   -> real-bound sizing (512 MB)
#       and the two run-time guards armed. This is the two-node recipe.
# READ-ONLY OVERLAY: model_executor/layers/sparse_attn_indexer_kpool.py is
# bind-mounted read-only from $OVERLAY_DIR, so that half must be pre-applied to
# the host-side overlay copy; the script then reports "already patched" for it
# here and writes only the image's own indexer.py. Run it against a copy of the
# overlay, not against the overlay a running engine is mounting.
# Same fail-closed `run` wrapper as every arm above: a drifted anchor stops the
# rank instead of serving a silently-wrong model.
