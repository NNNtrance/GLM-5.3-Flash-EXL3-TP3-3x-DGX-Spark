# Engine preflight, run by harem-exl3.service as ExecStartPre on every node.
# Waits (at most 10 minutes) until this node can actually serve, then checks
# that the three things a boot needs are on disk before the container starts.
#
#   1. docker is up and answering
#   2. all four ConnectX-7 ports report PORT_ACTIVE (ibv_devinfo)
#   3. this node can ping both of its fabric neighbours
#   4. sync + drop_caches
#   5. the env file exists
#   6. the image named in it is present locally
#   7. this rank's fast-load sidecar has its MANIFEST.json
#
# Why 2 and 3 exist: at boot the engine starts long before the fabric is ready.
# Without them the NCCL rendezvous hangs with no useful error and the unit sits
# in "activating" until TimeoutStartSec expires. Failing here instead is loud
# and names the missing link.
#
# Why 5 to 7 exist: each of them has failed us as a silent boot. A missing env
# file starts the engine on defaults; a missing image pulls or fails deep inside
# docker; a missing or half-written sidecar turns a 251 s boot into a 620 s one
# or into the fast-load refusal in docs/14 section 3.1. Checking them costs
# milliseconds and turns three late failures into one early message.
#
# FABRIC_PEERS: the two fabric addresses THIS node must be able to reach. The
# three nodes are wired as a ring of three cables carrying six logical links, so
# each node has two neighbours and a different pair of addresses (docs/00
# section 4.5). Set it per node in the environment, or fill in the case below.
# The addresses shown follow the example range in docs/00 section 4.5 -- they
# are NOT ours and you must substitute your own.
#
#   head      FABRIC_PEERS="172.31.0.2 172.31.2.2"
#   worker-1  FABRIC_PEERS="172.31.0.1 172.31.4.2"
#   worker-2  FABRIC_PEERS="172.31.2.1 172.31.4.1"
#
# Note what this does NOT check: it pings one address per neighbour, which is
# one link of each pair. PORT_ACTIVE on the other two is link state, not proof
# that anything crosses them -- read port_xmit_data as a delta after the first
# benchmark instead (docs/06 section 6).
#
# drop_caches needs root: either run the unit as root, or give the service user
# a NOPASSWD sudoers line for /usr/bin/tee /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches. If it is
# not permitted the script does not fail -- it just skips the drop.
