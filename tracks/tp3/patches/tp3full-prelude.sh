# the patch scripts, which differ from the production ones in exactly two
# constants (vocab padding_size lcm(128,tp)=384 instead of lcm(64,tp)=192;
# shared expert 2304 instead of 2112 -- both no-ops at tp<=2) plus one extra
# patch, patch-fullscope-tp3.py. ~/exl3-zeus/tp3/ is the production fastload
# manifest identity and is not touched: a new file there has already refused a
# production boot twice.
#
# Mount this at /start.sh and launch the image with `--entrypoint bash /start.sh`,
# passing the usual `vllm serve` arguments after it. It applies the three patch
# scripts and then execs the server, so a patch that no longer applies stops the
# rank instead of serving a silently-wrong model.

# $HOME/exl3-zeus/tp3full. The launcher mounts "$TP3_DIR/tp3-prelude.sh", so

# NOT in this tree: measured on 6 September, neither a benefit nor a cost could be
# resolved for item 4, and the instrument stalls the step it fires in. Item 4 is

#   kpool  items 2+3  the K-pool top-k buffer init AND its reader's upper bound
#
# READ-ONLY OVERLAY: model_executor/layers/sparse_attn_indexer_kpool.py is bind-
# mounted read-only from $OVERLAY_DIR, and item 2 targets exactly that file, so it
# cannot be written from inside the container. Pre-apply item 2 to a host-side copy
# of the overlay directory and point OVERLAY_DIR at that copy; patch-kpool-init.py
# then reports "already applied" for it and writes only the image's own
# kpool_compress.py (item 3). This applies to ANY future patch on an overlaid file.

# --- indexer K-gather workspace bound (6 September 2026, production 12) ------
# Upstream sizes the sparse indexer's K-gather workspace as 40 * max_model_len
# ENTRIES -- a constant chosen against DeepSeek-V3.2's 163840 context, where it
# comes to 825 MB. At max_model_len = 1e6 that is 4.92 GiB, reserved during the
# profile run, locked by lock_workspace() for the life of the engine and charged
# to the residual the profiler subtracts before it sizes the KV pool. The buffer
# only ever holds ONE indexer chunk's COMPRESSED context, so its real ceiling is
# max_num_seqs * ceil((max_model_len + num_spec + 1) / index_kpool).
# Measurements: results/memory/indexer-workspace-ab.md.
#
# The patch is applied UNCONDITIONALLY here and its BEHAVIOUR is env-gated,
# default OFF:
#   HAREM_INDEXER_WS_MODE unset / off / upstream  -> upstream sizing, byte for
#       byte, guards L2+L3 disarmed (one environment read at import).
#   HAREM_INDEXER_WS_MODE=bound                   -> real-bound sizing (512 MB)
#       and the two run-time guards armed. This is production 12.
# READ-ONLY OVERLAY, again: model_executor/layers/sparse_attn_indexer_kpool.py is
# bind-mounted read-only from $OVERLAY_DIR -- the same file sm_12x item 2 lands
# on -- so that half is pre-applied to the host-side overlay copy and the script
# reports "already patched" for it here, writing only the image's own indexer.py.

#   S3  KDA refactorisation: checkpoint `conv1d` -> q/k/v_conv1d, and
#       `qkv_proj` -> shards 0-2 of a split `in_proj_qkv`
#   A9  split a pre-fused checkpoint tensor by the CHECKPOINT widths, not the
#       module's padded ones (TP=3 head pad 64 -> 66)
#   A10 post-load audit: every EXL3 pad is whole 128-blocks and exactly zero
# Only for a FULL-SCOPE EXL3 checkpoint (turboderp/GLM-5.3-Flash-exl3@4.05bpw).
# HAREM_EXL3_FULLSCOPE unset == upstream image behaviour, byte for byte, and

# serves the routed-experts-only control checkpoint correctly.
# Design and measurements: docs/13 of the recipe repository.
# TP=3 pad arithmetic: docs/13 section 7.1.
# TP=3 needs a cuda-exl3 with the padded-load path: f3e3090 (padded output dim,
# row-parallel suh) AND 754421f (the vocab loaders fill a prefix). On an older
# image the lm_head load dies -- 62f53e6/5903248 raise "EXL3 weights cannot be
